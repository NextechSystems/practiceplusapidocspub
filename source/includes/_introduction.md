# Introduction

The Nextech Select APIs provide secure access to patient data through a RESTful implementation based on the STU 3 (3.0.1) version of the [FHIRÂ® standard](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/index.html). All API requests are performed over HTTPS and are protected by the [OAuth 2.0 standard](https://oauth.net/2/).

Available API functionality:  

* Patient demographics  
* Patient clinical information  
* Appointment information  
* Confirm appointments  
* Create non-clinical patient notes
* Attach patient documents
